# Buttons-CoHort6
Patrick will be discussing React.js using our last challenge as an example!
### MEDIUM: 
Create a child Contact component inside the original component you created that you pass in a firstName, lastName, and phoneNumber and print out "You need to contact {firstName} {lastName} at {phoneNumber}
### HARD: 
Using an array of contacts, loop through each one and create a new Contact component for each
### VERY HARD: 
In your list of Contacts, have a status icon by each one that starts as orange "Pending" status. Then have a call button that when clicked, changes the state to a green "Done" status.
